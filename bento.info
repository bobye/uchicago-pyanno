Description:
    pyAnno 2.0 is a Python library for the analysis and diagnostic testing of
    annotation and curation efforts. pyAnno implements statistical models for
    categorical data annotated by multiple annotators. The models include a
    generalization of Dawid and Skene's (1979) multinomial
    model with Dirichlet priors on prevalence and estimator accuracy,
    and the two models introduces in Rzhetsky et al.'s (2009). The implementation
    allows Maximum Likelihood and Maximum A Posteriori estimation of parameters,
    and to draw samples from the full posterior distribution over annotator
    accuracy.
